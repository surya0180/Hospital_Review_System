# To all my team members
I created the Directory structure for temporary purpose. It will be changed according to the progress of our project.

# RULES
* Add a commit id to each and every commit you make in this repo.
* commit id = "NAME#your_nth_commit_number".
* Eg. abcd#5 => person name "abcd" and his commit number is 5.
* Also note that, follow the same process while keeping the PR's.

* Dont forget to fork this repo and work on it.
* Create multiple branches so that you can work more efficiently.
* Make sure you always pull the changes made in the master repo.
* While coding, remember to add some comments so that it would be helpful to master repo when it merges the PR.

# NOTICE BOARD
**Will update this section daily**

# Important Notice 1
I changed the repo structure once again to normal form.
Before it was in react structure and now it is in normal structure.

I request everyone to please fork the repo **( If not forked yet )** 
or pull the changes from master repo **( If already forked )**

And start working on the project from now

the date for 2nd review might be on march 12th ( according to the course plan ). Since the 1st review itself was postponed by a week, we can expect the 2nd review on march 18th, but there is no gurantee for it too.

We may even have scheduled quizes or assignments of other courses in between.

I dont want any delays in the work, and it needs to be done perfectly. Since your tasks have already been alloted, there should be no misunderstandings in the work.

**Clock is ticking and we have exactly 18 days for the 2nd review( Estimated ). I want the frontend of the project to be completed before two days of the 2nd evaluation.**

Please take these points into consideration and **start working from today**
